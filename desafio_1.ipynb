Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.\\n \\nLasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza\\nbatting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder\\nand Webster.\\n \\nPiazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.\\nThe Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single\\nby Offerman.\\n \\nBy the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but\\nthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\\n \\nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\\nthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw\\nto third and EASILY got the runner at third.\\n \\nMy heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.\\n \\nAstacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game\\nwith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.\\n \\nGross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3\\ninnings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning\\ngame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh\\ngiven his light work out Tuesday.\\n \\nGross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit\\nto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted\\nin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it\\n3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next\\nthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on\\nfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had\\nscored long before that.\\n \\nMeanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.\\nLee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros\\nand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).\\nCory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but\\nthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his\\nthird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my\\nfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this\\nup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year\\nhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs\\nof a sophomore jinx year.\\n \\nThe final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.\\nDodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.</td>\n",

When the IF rule is invoked,\\nthe batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from being\\nforced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Other\\nthan that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on\\na base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? That is,\\nif the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and\\nif the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.\\n   \n",

I believe the rule also does *not* deal with this\\nsituation:\\n\\nIf Infield Fly is declared and the ball is caught, runners can tag up\\nand advance at their own risk, as on any fly ball.\\n\\nHowever, if the Infield Fly is *not* caught, at what point can a\\nrunner legally leave his base w/o fear of being doubled off for\\nadvancing too early?  When the\\nball hits the ground?  When a fielder first touches the ball after it\\nhits the ground?\\n\\nEnlightenment would be appreciated.   \n",

       "3  Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.\\n \\nAstacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night.\\nIn the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then\\na single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the\\nthrow home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.\\n \\nLasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza\\nbatting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder\\nand Webster.\\n \\nPiazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.\\nThe Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single\\nby Offerman.\\n \\nBy the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but\\nthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\\n \\nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\\nthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw\\nto third and EASILY got the runner at third.\\n \\nMy heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.\\n \\nAstacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game\\nwith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.\\n \\nGross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3\\ninnings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning\\ngame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh\\ngiven his light work out Tuesday.\\n \\nGross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit\\nto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted\\nin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it\\n3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next\\nthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on\\nfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had\\nscored long before that.\\n \\nMeanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.\\nLee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros\\nand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).\\nCory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but\\nthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his\\nthird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my\\nfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this\\nup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year\\nhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs\\nof a sophomore jinx year.\\n \\nThe final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.\\nDodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.   \n",
